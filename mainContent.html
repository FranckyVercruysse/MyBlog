<h4>Create single and two-column layouts for main content</h4>

If you re-look at <a href="#mockups">mockups</a>,
our main content is split into a two-column layout for desktop screen
and combined into a single column in mobile screen.
In case of desktop, the first column contains the latest posts and the second column contains the sidebar.
While in mobile screen, the sidebar falls below the main content.

<h5>Grid system</h5>

Bootstrap includes a  powerful mobile-first flexbox <a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/grid/" target="_blank">grid system</a> for building layouts of all shapes and sizes.
It’s based on a 12 column layout and has multiple tiers, one for each media query range.
You can use it with Sass mixins or our predefined classes.

Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content.
It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive.

<h5>Complete the main content layout</h5>

Our main content of home page is primarily divided into two things: latest posts and sidebar.
If you remember the mockups, in case of mobile and tablets,
we want both the latest posts section and sidebar to be displayed one below other as a single column
but in case of desktops and large screens we want them to be placed aside.
When they placed horizontally, we want the latest posts section to occupy 2/3rd of the total viewport size.

To accomplish this, we've to create a row element (div) under the existing "#body" (div) element
with two column elements (div).
The first column element is decorated with col-md-8 and the second one with col-md-4.
